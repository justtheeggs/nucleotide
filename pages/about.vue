      <h2>What is Nucleotide?</h2>
      <p>
        Interested in science?  Have a science project that needs help?  Nucleotide can help.  Nucleotide is a tool for connecting projects with team members.
        This tool allows users to register, create projects, and list their skills.  As projects progress and tasks complete, project owners can endorse their
        team members skills. This allows users to build their catalog of skills and keep projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool also provides recomendations to users about available projects they might be interested in.

      <p>
        Just the Eggs is spin off group from Just the Ducks.  We are a group of professional coders who enjoy a good challenge.
        We are a group of 6 coders by day and NASA enthusiasts by night. Our group was formed while seeking unique coding
        experiences outside of our normal work environment. We spend our days building and supporting information systems
        for a mild mannered insurance company in Flint, Michigan. By night we challenge ourselves with coding and camaraderie.
        We joined the 2022 NASA Space Apps challenge with the goal of expanding our skills and experiencing NASA to the fullest.
